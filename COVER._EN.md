# **Cover Letter ‚Äì Willian David Soncini**

Dear Hiring Manager,

I'm writing to express my interest in mid-to-senior level opportunities in **Software Engineering** or **Data Engineering**. With over **7 years of professional experience** in both areas, I bring a solid blend of backend and frontend development expertise along with deep knowledge in data pipelines, ETL automation, and cloud infrastructure.

Throughout my career, I have contributed to complex projects in both local and multinational environments. My background includes:

- **Full Stack Development** using **Python (FastAPI, Django, Flask)**, **Node.js**, and **React/Next.js/Flutter**, creating scalable, high-performance web applications.
- Building and maintaining **data pipelines** and ETL jobs using **Apache Airflow, AWS Glue, Redshift**, and **SAP-HANA**, processing high volumes of business-critical data.
- Hands-on experience with **cloud platforms** such as **AWS and GCP**, applying infrastructure-as-code with **Terraform**, and delivering CI/CD automation via **GitHub Actions**.
- Implementation of **business intelligence solutions** using **Power BI**, and automation of workflows with **Power Automate** and **SharePoint integrations**.

In my most recent role at **Nutrien**, I led the development of a custom sales approval platform and maintained a distributed data infrastructure with hundreds of automated jobs running in production. At **Safra Rica**, I was responsible for building a data warehouse from scratch and increasing dashboard performance by over 90%, directly supporting strategic decisions by the executive team.

What drives me is the challenge of creating robust, elegant solutions that improve system efficiency and business outcomes. I enjoy working in collaborative, fast-paced environments where clean architecture, automation, and continuous improvement are valued.

I would welcome the opportunity to bring my skills and experience to your team and contribute to high-impact technical projects.
